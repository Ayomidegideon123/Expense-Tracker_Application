# Expense-Tracker_App

# About the app
* This project aims to build an Expense Tracker based on GUI. In order to build this, we

will require an intermediate knowledge and understanding of the Tkinter library, SQL

language and its commands, and fundamental knowledge of different modules of the

Tkinter library and the tkcalendar library.*

# Technology used
1. Tkinter:The tkinter module will help us provide the Graphical User Interface (GUI)

to the application.

2. Tkcalendar:The tkcalendar module will help us to work with the drop-down

calendar.

3. SQLite: The sqlite module will allow us to connect the Python script to the SQL

database.

4. Datetime: The datetime module will allow to work with date and time.

Since Tkinter, Datetime, and SQLite come as preinstalled modules in Python, there is no

need to install them manually. However, we only require installing the Tkcalendar

module.

The tkcalendar module can be installed using the PIP installer by typing the following

command in a command prompt or terminal.

Syntax:

1. # installing the PyGame library

2. $ pip install tkcalendar

Once the installation is complete, we can verify whether the tkcalendar library is

installed properly or not by creating a new python program file and importing the

tkcalendar module.

# What you can do on the app

# 2. You can input the transaction made, the amount and so on
# 3. You will be able to track your transaction
